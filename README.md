# Sphygmomanometer

This project is a Java program that simulates a sphygmomanometer (instrument for measuring blood pressure).

The sphygmomanometer (Blood Pressure Monitor) device comprises PatientBloodPressure and it has following features:

-Name

-Age

-Systolic (Sys)

-Diastolic (Dia)

-Pulse

The blood pressure of each patient can be categorised according to the decision table:
 
 
 Category                   | Systolic        | Diastolic
-------------               | -------------   | ----------
Normal                      | Sys < 120       | Dia < 80
Elevated                    | 119 < Sys < 130 | Dia < 80
Stage 1 high blood pressure | 129 < Sys < 140 | 79 < Dia < 90
Stage 2 high blood pressure | 139 < Sys       | 89 < Dia


Our Java application should do:

1- Insert a patient record

2- Delete a patient record

3- Calculate average values

4- Display min/max values

5- Show the category of the patient
